## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Child Components Not Included:**
   - `ProjectStats.tsx` - needs separate translation

   - `ProjectServices.tsx` - needs separate translation
   - `ProjectTeam.tsx` - needs separate translation
   - `SubProjects.tsx` - needs separate translation

2. **Toast Notifications:**
   - Some success/error toasts still hardcoded in Albanian
   - Recommendation: Move to translation keys for consistency

3. **Minor Filter Placeholders:**
   - Some dropdown placeholders in overview filters may need refinement
